# Terms of Service
*Last updated: Jan 24, 2024*

From everyone at Culturalyst, thank you for using our platform! We built Culturalyst to provide helpful tools to artists and arts-support organizations, to make it easier for cultural consumers to connect with the creators of culture, and to create a future where there is solid, public-good infrastructure in place for artists everywhere. We provide these Terms of Service in order to ensure everyone is on the same page.

**When we say “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us” in this document, we are referring to Culturalyst LLC.**

**When we say “Services”, we mean our websites, Culturalyst.com as well as any city-specific sites (neworleans.culturalyst.com, newhaven.culturalyst.com, etc), whether delivered within a web browser, desktop application, mobile application, or another format.**

**When we say “You” or “your”, we are referring to the people or organizations that own an account with one or more of our Services.**

We may update these Terms of Service ("Terms") in the future. You can track all changes made on [GitHub](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo). Typically these changes have been to clarify some of these terms by linking to an expanded related policy. Whenever we make a significant change to our policies, we will refresh the date at the top of this page and take any other appropriate steps to notify account holders.

When you use our Services, now or in the future, you are agreeing to the latest Terms. There may be times where we do not exercise or enforce a right or provision of the Terms; however, that does not mean we are waiving that right or provision. These Terms do contain a limitation of our liability.

If you violate any of the Terms, we may terminate your account. That’s a broad statement and it means you need to place a lot of trust in us. We do our best to deserve that trust by being transparent and keeping an open door to your feedback: [info@culturalyst.com](mailto:info@culturalyst.com)

## Account Terms

- You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password and for ensuring that any of your users do the same. The Company cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.

- You may not use the Services for any purpose outlined in our Use Restrictions policy, and you may not permit any of your users to do so, either.

- You are responsible for all content posted to and activity that occurs under your account, including content posted by and activity of any users in your account.

- You must be a human. Accounts registered by “bots” or other automated methods are not permitted.

## Payment, Refunds, and Plan Changes

- If you are using Culturalyst as an artist or an organization, it is really free: we do not ask you for your credit card and — just like for customers who pay for our Services — we do not sell your data.

- In most cases, each directory in our network is paid for by a local or state arts agency. By signing up, you are agreeing to allow your data to be accessed by that state or local arts agency. We outline what data is available both to our staff and the Admins for the state and local arts agency in our Culturalyst Data Processing Addendum.

- In the future, we may add features that a user can opt in to utilizing for a fee, charged by Culturalyst. If we add these features, we will update these Terms of Service to outline our payment, refund, and plan change policies. Obviously, if these features are added, it will be abundantly clear that a user has to pay for them.

## Account Termination

- You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. Within each of our Services, we provide a simple no-questions-asked cancellation link. You can find instructions for how to cancel your account in our Cancellation policy. An email or phone request to cancel your account is not automatically considered cancellation. If you need help canceling your account, you can always contact our Support team [info@culturalyst.com](mailto:info@culturalyst.com)

- All of your content will be inaccessible from the Services immediately upon account cancellation. We cannot recover this information once it has been permanently deleted. If you want to export any data before your account is canceled, please email us at [info@culturalyst.com](mailto:info@culturalyst.com)

- We have the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of our Services for any reason at any time. Suspension means you and any other users on your account will not be able to access the account or any content in the account. Termination will furthermore result in the deletion of your account or your access to your account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all content in your account. We also reserve the right to refuse the use of the Services to anyone for any reason at any time. We have this clause because statistically speaking, out of the thousands of accounts on our Services, there is at least one doing something nefarious. There are some things we staunchly stand against and this clause is how we exercise that stance. For more details, see our Use Restrictions policy.

## Modifications to the Service

- We make a promise to our customers to support our Services as long as we are in business. That means when it comes to security, privacy, and customer support, we will continue to maintain any legacy Services. Sometimes it becomes technically impossible to continue a feature or we redesign a part of our Services because we think it could be better or we decide to close new signups of a product. We reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any part of our Services with or without notice.

## Uptime, Security, and Privacy

- Your use of the Services is at your sole risk. We provide these Services on an “as is” and “as available” basis.

- We reserve the right to temporarily disable your account if your usage significantly exceeds the average usage of other customers of the Services. Of course, we’ll reach out to the account owner before taking any action except in rare cases where the level of use may negatively impact the performance of the Service for other customers.

- We take many measures to protect and secure your data through backups, redundancies, and encryption. We enforce encryption for data transmission from the public Internet. There are some edge cases where we may send your data through our network unencrypted. Please refer to our Security Overview for full details.

- When you use our Services, you entrust us with your data. We take that trust to heart. You agree that Culturalyst may process your data as described in our Privacy Policy and for no other purpose. We as humans can access your data for the following reasons:
    - To help you with support requests you make. We’ll ask for express consent before accessing your account.
    - On the rare occasions when an error occurs that stops an automated process partway through. We get automated alerts when such errors occur. When we can fix the issue and restart automated processing without looking at any personal data, we do. In rare cases, we have to look at a minimum amount of personal data to fix the issue. In these rare cases, we aim to fix the root cause to prevent the errors from recurring.
    - To safeguard Culturalyst. We’ll look at logs and metadata as part of our work to ensure the security of your data and the Services as a whole. If necessary, we may also access accounts as part of an abuse report investigation.
    - To the extent required by applicable law. As a US company with all data infrastructure located in the US, we only preserve or share customer data if compelled by a US government authority with a legally binding order or proper request under the Stored Communications Act, or in limited circumstances in the event of an emergency request. If a non-US authority approaches Culturalyst for assistance, our default stance is to refuse unless the order has been approved by the US government, which compels us to comply through procedures outlined in an established mutual legal assistance treaty or agreement mechanism. If Culturalyst is audited by a tax authority, we only share the bare minimum billing information needed to complete the audit.

- We use third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Services. You can see a list of all subprocessors here: [Company processors](https://example.com/subprocessors).

- Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), Culturalyst is a “service provider”, not a “business” or “third party”, with respect to your use of the Services. That means we process any data you share with us only for the purpose you signed up for and as described in these Terms, the Privacy policy, and other policies. We do not retain, use, disclose, or sell any of that information for any other commercial purposes unless we have your explicit permission. And on the flip-side, you agree to comply with your requirements under the CCPA and not use Culturalyst’s Services in a way that violates the regulations.

- These Terms incorporate the Culturalyst Data Processing Addendum (“DPA”) when the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) or United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation (“UK GDPR”) applies to your use of Culturalyst Services to process Customer Data as defined in the DPA. The DPA linked above supersedes any previously agreed data processing addendum between you and Culturalyst LLC relating to your use of the Culturalyst Services.

## Copyright and Content Ownership

- All content posted on the Services must comply with U.S. copyright law. We provide details on how to file a copyright infringement claim.

- You give us a limited license to use the content posted by you and your users in order to provide the Services to you, but we claim no ownership rights over those materials. All materials you submit to the Services remain yours.

- We do not pre-screen content, but we reserve the right (but not the obligation) in our sole discretion to refuse or remove any content that is available via the Service.

- The Company or its licensors own all right, title, and interest in and to the Services, including all intellectual property rights therein, and you obtain no ownership rights in the Services as a result of your use. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements without express written permission from the Company.

- You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Services, use of the Services, or access to the Services without the express written permission of the Company.

## Features and Bugs

- We design our Services with care, based on our own experience and the experiences of customers who share their time and feedback. However, there is no such thing as a service that pleases everybody. We make no guarantees that our Services will meet your specific requirements or expectations.

- We also test all of our features extensively before shipping them. As with any software, our Services inevitably have some bugs. We track the bugs reported to us and work through priority ones, especially any related to security or privacy. Not all reported bugs will get fixed and we don’t guarantee completely error-free Services.

## Liability

- We mention liability throughout these Terms but to put it all in one section:

  **NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY, EXCEPT FOR BODILY INJURY OF A PERSON, COMPANY AND ITS SUPPLIERS (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ALL EQUIPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY SUPPLIERS), OFFICERS, AFFILIATES, REPRESENTATIVES, CONTRACTORS AND EMPLOYEES SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT OR TERMS AND CONDITIONS RELATED THERETO UNDER ANY CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER THEORY: (A) FOR ERROR OR INTERRUPTION OF USE OR FOR LOSS OR INACCURACY OR CORRUPTION OF DATA OR COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS, SERVICES OR TECHNOLOGY OR LOSS OF BUSINESS; (B) FOR ANY INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES; (C) FOR ANY MATTER BEYOND COMPANY’S REASONABLE CONTROL; OR (D) FOR ANY AMOUNTS THAT, TOGETHER WITH AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH ALL OTHER CLAIMS, EXCEED THE FEES PAID BY CUSTOMER TO COMPANY FOR THE SERVICES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE ACT THAT GAVE RISE TO THE LIABILITY, IN EACH CASE, WHETHER OR NOT COMPANY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.**

In other words: choosing to use our Services does mean you are making a bet on us. If the bet does not work out, that’s on you, not us. We do everything in our power to be as safe a bet as possible through careful management of the business; investments in security, infrastructure, and talent. If you choose to use our Services, thank you for betting on us.

If you have a question about any of these Terms, please [contact us](mailto:info@culturalyst.com).
