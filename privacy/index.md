# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: Jan 19, 2024**

The privacy of your data—and it is your data, not ours!—is a big deal to us. In this policy, we lay out: what data we collect and why; how your data is handled; and your rights with respect to your data. This policy is split into sections. For your convenience, links to each of those sections is as follows:

- [Privacy policy](#privacy-policy)
- [What we collect and why](#what-we-collect-and-why)
- [When we access or disclose your information](#when-we-access-or-disclose-your-information)
- [Your rights with respect to your information](#your-rights-with-respect-to-your-information)
- [How we secure your data](#how-we-secure-your-data)
- [What happens when you delete content in your product accounts](#what-happens-when-you-delete-content-in-your-product-accounts)
- [Data retention](#data-retention)
- [Location of site and data](#location-of-site-and-data)

This policy applies to our handling of information about site visitors, prospective customers, and customers and authorized users (in relation to their procurement of the services and management of their relationship with Culturalyst). We refer collectively to these categories of individuals as "you" throughout this policy. However, this policy does not cover information about a customer’s end users that Culturalyst receives from a customer, or otherwise processes on a customer’s behalf, in connection with the services provided by Culturalyst to the customer pursuant to an applicable services agreement (including the content of messages of customer end users ("End User Communications")). Culturalyst processes End User Communications under the instructions of the relevant customer, which is the "data controller" or "business" (or occupies a similar role as defined in applicable privacy laws), as described in the applicable services agreement between such customer and Culturalyst. Culturalyst’s obligations as a "data processor" or "service provider" with respect to such information are defined in such services agreement and applicable data protection addendum and are not made part of this policy.

## What we collect and why

Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need. Here’s what that means in practice:

### Identity and access

When you sign up for a Culturalyst product, we ask for identifying information such as your name, email address. That’s so you can personalize your new account, and we can send you product updates and other essential information. We may also send you optional surveys from time to time to help us understand how you use our products and to make improvements. With your consent, we will send you our newsletter and other updates. We sometimes also give you the option to add a profile picture that displays in our products.

### Add artist profile information

### Product interactions

We store on our servers the content that you upload or receive or maintain in your Culturalyst product accounts. This is so you can use our products as intended, for example, to create a portfolio site or organizational profile in our directory or to sign-up for our automated emails containing arts opportunities. We keep this content as long as your account is active. If you delete your account, we’ll delete the content immediately.

### General Geolocation data

If there is an Events calendar on the city directory that you sign up to be a part of, we’ll ask you your location so that we can show you how far away you are from certain events. Of course, you have the ability to disallow us from knowing your location by denying the request in your browser.

### Website interactions

We collect information about your browsing activity for analytics and statistical purposes such as conversion rate testing and experimenting with new product designs. This includes, for example, your browser and operating system versions, your IP address, which web pages you visited and how long they took to load, and which website referred you to us. If you have an account and are signed in, these web analytics data are tied to your IP address and user account until your account is no longer active. We use Google analytics to monitor your interactions with Culturalyst’s sites. You can find their Terms of Service [here](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy).

## When we access or disclose your information

To provide products or services you’ve requested.

No Culturalyst human looks at your content except for limited purposes with your express permission, for example, if an error occurs that stops an automated process from working and requires manual intervention to fix.

To help you troubleshoot or squash a software bug, with your permission. If at any point we need to access your content to help you with a support case, we will ask for your consent before proceeding.

To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding restricted uses. Accessing a customer’s account when investigating potential abuse is a measure of last resort. We want to protect the privacy and safety of both our customers and the people reporting issues to us, and we do our best to balance those responsibilities throughout the process. If we discover you are using our products for a restricted purpose, we will take action as necessary, including notifying appropriate authorities where warranted.

Aggregated and de-identified data. We may aggregate and/or de-identify information collected through the services. We may use de-identified or aggregated data for any purpose, including marketing or analytics.

When required under applicable law. Culturalyst is a U.S. company and all data infrastructure are located in the U.S.

Requests for user data. Our policy is to not respond to government requests for user data unless we are compelled by legal process or in limited circumstances in the event of an emergency request. However, if U.S. law enforcement authorities have the necessary warrant, criminal subpoena, or court order requiring us to disclose data, we must comply. Likewise, we will only respond to requests from government authorities outside the U.S. if compelled by the U.S. government through procedures outlined in a mutual legal assistance treaty or agreement. It is Culturalyst’ policy to notify affected users before we disclose data unless we are legally prohibited from doing so, and except in some emergency cases.

Preservation requests. Similarly, Culturalyst’ policy is to comply with requests to preserve data only if compelled by the U.S. Federal Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 2703(f), or by a properly served U.S. subpoena for civil matters. We do not disclose preserved data unless required by law or compelled by a court order that we choose not to appeal. Furthermore, unless we receive a proper warrant, court order, or subpoena before the required preservation period expires, we will destroy any preserved copies of customer data at the end of the preservation period.

Finally, if Culturalyst is acquired by or merges with another company, we’ll notify you well before any of your personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

## Your rights with respect to your information

At Culturalyst, we strive to apply the same data rights to all customers, regardless of their location. Some of these rights include:

Right to Know. You have the right to know what personal information is collected, used, shared or sold. We outline both the categories and specific bits of data we collect, as well as how they are used, in this privacy policy.

Right of Access. This includes your right to access the personal information we gather about you, and your right to obtain information about the sharing, storage, security and processing of that information.

Right to Correction. You have the right to request correction of your personal information or to correct it yourself at any time via your account.

Right to Erasure / “To Be Forgotten”. This is your right to request, subject to certain limitations under applicable law, that your personal information be erased from our possession and, by extension, from all of our service providers. Fulfillment of some data deletion requests may prevent you from using Culturalyst services because our applications may then no longer work. In such cases, a data deletion request may result in closing your account.

Right to Complain. You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of your personal information with the appropriate supervisory authority.

Right to Restrict Processing. This is your right to request restriction of how and why your personal information is used or processed, including opting out of sale of your personal information. (Again: we never have and never will sell your personal data.)

Right to Object. You have the right, in certain situations, to object to how or why your personal information is processed.

Right to Portability. You have the right to receive the personal information we have about you and the right to transmit it to another party. If you want to export data from your accounts, you can do so directly by emailing us at [info@culturalyst.com](mailto:info@culturalyst.com). You will receive all your personal data extracted and sent to you in a JSON format.

Right to not Be Subject to Automated Decision-Making. You have the right to object to and prevent any decision that could have a legal or similarly significant effect on you from being made solely based on automated processes. This right is limited if the decision is necessary for performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable law, or is based on your explicit consent.

Right to Non-Discrimination. We do not and will not charge you a different amount to use our products, offer you different discounts, or give you a lower level of customer service because you have exercised your data privacy rights. However, the exercise of certain rights may, by virtue of your exercising those rights, prevent you from using our Services.

Many of these rights can be exercised by signing in and updating your account information. Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. For example, we need to retain certain information in order to provide our services to you. In some cases, we also need to take reasonable steps to verify your identity before responding to a request, which may include, at a minimum, depending on the sensitivity of the information you are requesting and the type of request you are making, verifying your name and email address. If we are unable to verify you, we may be unable to respond to your requests. If you have questions about exercising these rights or need assistance, please contact us at [info@Culturalyst.com](mailto:info@Culturalyst.com) or at Culturalyst LLC, 4708 Burgundy Street, New Orleans, USA. If an authorized agent is corresponding on your behalf, we will need written consent with a signature from the account holder before proceeding. Depending on applicable law, you may have the right to appeal our decision to deny your request, if applicable. We will provide information about how to exercise that right in our response denying the request. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. If you are in the EU or UK, you can contact your data protection authority to file a complaint or learn more about local privacy laws.

## How we secure your data

All data is encrypted via SSL/TLS when transmitted from our servers to your browser. The database backups are also encrypted. In addition, we go to great lengths to secure your data at rest. For more information about how we keep your information secure, please review our [security overview](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy). Most data are not encrypted while they live in our database (since they need to be ready to send to you when you need them). Our servers decrypt the data to send it to you when you need it. You can learn more about our approach to security for HEY at [here](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy).

## What happens when you delete content in your product accounts

In many of our applications, we give you the option to trash content. Anything you trash in your product accounts while they are active will be deleted immediately. If you choose to cancel your account, your content will be immediately deleted.

## Data retention

We keep your information for the time necessary for the purposes for which it is processed. The length of time for which we retain information depends on the purposes for which we collected and use it and your choices, after which time we may delete and/or aggregate it. We may also retain and use this information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Through this policy, we have provided specific retention periods for certain types of information.

## Location of site and data

Our products and other web properties are operated in the United States. If you are located in the European Union, UK, or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to and stored in the United States. By using our websites or Services and/or providing us with your personal information, you consent to this transfer.

## When transferring personal data from the EU

The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) has issued guidance that personal data transferred out of the EU must be treated with the same level of protection that is granted under EU privacy law. UK law provides similar safeguards for UK user data that is transferred out of the UK. Accordingly, Culturalyst has adopted a data processing addendum with Standard Contractual Clauses to help ensure this protection. Culturalyst’ DPA is available at [here](https://basecamp.com/about/policies/privacy/regulations/basecamp-gdpr-dpa.pdf). There are also a few ad hoc cases where EU personal data may be transferred to the U.S. in connection with Culturalyst operations, for instance, if an EU user signs up for our newsletter or participates in one of our surveys or buys swag from our company online store. Such transfers are only occasional and data is transferred under the Article 49(1)(b) derogation under GDPR and the UK version of GDPR
